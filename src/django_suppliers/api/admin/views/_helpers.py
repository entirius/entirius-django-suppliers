"""Shared helpers for admin API views.

Single responsibility: convert service-layer exceptions (ValueError, InvalidOperation)
into DRF exceptions so the v2 exception handler can emit the standard v2 error shape
(`{error, message, debug_id, details}`).

NEVER use `return Response({"detail": str(e)}, ...)` in views — that bypasses the
v2 exception handler and leaks legacy `{detail}` shape. Use `raise_as_drf(exc)` or
raise the appropriate `drf_exceptions.*` directly.
