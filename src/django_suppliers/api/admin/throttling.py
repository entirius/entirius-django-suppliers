"""Throttle classes for admin API endpoints.

`BulkHasChangesThrottle` protects the bulk badge lookup
(`/pim-sku/has-changes/?skus=...`) which can be hit aggressively by a PIM list
view paginating through products. 120 req/min/user is generous (one page-load
per second with margin) but caps runaway loops or leaked admin tokens.

Service-level override possible via `REST_FRAMEWORK["DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES"]`
with key `suppliers_change_log_bulk`. Falls back to 120/min when unset so a
mis-configured service never accidentally disables throttling.
