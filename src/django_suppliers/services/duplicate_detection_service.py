"""Duplicate RealProduct detection.

Reusable service shared between the `find_duplicate_realproducts` management
command and the `GET /api/suppliers/v2/admin/duplicates/` admin endpoint. Read-only.

Returns EAN groups that contain >1 RealProduct, each annotated with a per-group
suggestion (`merge` / `review`) based on the largest pairwise weight diff vs the
configurable tolerance. Conservative: any missing weight in a group bumps the
suggestion to `review` (no auto-guess).

The dataclasses below are intentionally plain (`@dataclass(frozen=True)`) and
contain primitives only -- the HTTP endpoint converts them to Pydantic for the
response, and the CLI command formats them as plain text. Neither touches ORM
after the service returns.
